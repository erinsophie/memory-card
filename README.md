# Features

This is a Zelda - Breath of The Wild inspired memory game. The objective is to click on each card once until you get them all. Each time a card is clicked, the deck reshuffles, so you have to remember which ones you have or have not yet clicked! The images on the cards are of meals that you can make in the game and the font is also like that of the one used in Zelda.

# Project goals

The main goal of this project was to improve on the concepts learned thus far, such as managing state and utilizing Hooks. It's interesting to review where state should live and why, what are the implications / benefits of where you decide to have state live, now and in the future. I try to keep state as local as possible, but sometimes during this project I had to compromise on where I wanted certain state to live by lifitng it up so it could be shared between multiple components. I'm still figuring out the pros and cons of this.
